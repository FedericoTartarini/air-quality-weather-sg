My name is Federico Tartarini, the developer of the Air\r\n            Quality and Weather SG website and applications for Android.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p className=\"mb-8 leading-relaxed\">\r\n            Air Quality and Weather SG is an easy to use website that allows you\r\n            to check the weather forecast and air quality in Singapore. You can\r\n            monitor the current weather conditions in your location as well as\r\n            the 24-h and 2-h weather forecasts for Singapore. It also features a\r\n            rain radar.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p className=\"mb-8 leading-relaxed\">\r\n            Air Quality and Weather SG is also a great tool to monitor outdoor\r\n            pollutants during the haze season in Singapore since it lets you to\r\n            monitor and track in real-time all the standard indices of the major\r\n            outdoor pollutants: Particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), Ozone (O3),\r\n            Nitrogen Oxide (NOx), Sulphur Oxide (SOx) and Carbon Monoxide in\r\n            Singapore. The websites also displays how these indices varied over\r\n            the course of the last 24 hours. So you can take informed decision\r\n            before heading out.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p className=\"mb-8 leading-relaxed\">\r\n            Air Quality and Weather SG uses data from the National Environment\r\n            Agency (NEA) in Singapore, hence, you trust the data.
