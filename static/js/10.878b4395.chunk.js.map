It has abundant rainfall\n            throughout the year, high temperatures and high relative humidity.\n            The outdoor temperature do not vary much between seasons. All months\n            have mean daily max temperature in the low thirties and mean daily\n            minimum temperatures in the mid twenties. The highest temperature\n            excursions are observed intra-day, at night outdoor temperatures are\n            significantly lower than during the day.\n          </p>\n          <h1 className=\"text-2xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900\">Rainfall</h1>\n          <p className=\"mb-8 leading-relaxed\">\n            In Singapore rains approximately every second day on average (167\n            days of rain). Rain if often heavy and afternoon thunderstorms are\n            frequent. The NEA reports that the long term total mean annual\n            rainfall is 2166 mm.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"mb-8 leading-relaxed\">\n            While in Singapore often rains and there is not an official dry\n            season, it generally rains more between November and January. This\n            is caused bu the fact that the tropical rain-belt moves towards\n            Singapore. While the driest month on average is February since the\n            same rain-belt moves south towards Java. Rainfall frequently occurs\n            in the afternoon, consequently most of the rin falls during the day\n            and not at night. In addition, despite the fact that Singapore is a\n            small country (approximately 50 km in width), most of the rain falls\n            on the western side of the island.\n          </p>\n          <h1 className=\"text-2xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900\">\n            Temperature\n          </h1>\n          <p className=\"mb-8 leading-relaxed\">\n            High temperatures are recorded in Singapore throughout the year. The\n            outdoor temperature rarely falls below 23 - 25 °C at night and does\n            not exceed 31 - 33 °C during the hottest hours of the day. May and\n            June are characterized by the highest mean monthly temperatures\n            (daily mean temperature 27.8 °C), while December and January are the\n            coolest months (daily mean temperature 26.0 °C). The tropical heat\n            is mitigated by the sea, which surrounds the whole country and\n            dampens temperature fluctuations between day and night and between\n            seasons. Bukit Timah is the highest point (163 meters) in Singapore\n            the temperature on this hill is not much lower than the other\n            surrounding areas.\n          </p>\n          <h1 className=\"text-2xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900\">\n            Relative Humidity\n          </h1>\n          <p className=\"mb-8 leading-relaxed\">\n            Singapore is very humid throughout the year. The biggest\n            fluctuations in relative humidity are observed between dawn and\n            mid-day due to the marked change in temperature between these two\n            periods. With relative higher than 90 % before sunrise and around 60\n            % in the early afternoon, when it does not rain. Despite the hot\n            temperatures recorded in Singapore, relative humidity frequently\n            reaches 100 %.\n          </p>\n          <h1 className=\"text-2xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900\">Seasons</h1>\n          <p className=\"mb-8 leading-relaxed\">\n            Singapore climate is characterized by two distinct monsoon seasons\n            separated by two inter-monsoonal periods. One monsoon season\n            (Northeast Monsoon) periodically occurs between December and early\n            March, while the second monsoon season is from June to September\n            (Southwest Monsoon).\n          </p>\n          <h1 className=\"text-xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900\">\n            Northeast Monsoon (Dec - Mar)\n          </h1>\n          <p className=\"mb-8 leading-relaxed\">\n            Is generally characterized by northerly to northeasterly winds and\n            it has two distinct phases. The wet phase (December to early\n            January) features moderate to heavy rains with wind gusts that can\n            reach up to 25-35 km/h, and rapid development of afternoon showers.\n            Which are caused the sun radiation heating up the ground which in\n            turns heats up the air. Hot air rises to produce convective clouds\n            which can turn into intense thunderstorms if the monsoon-rain belt\n            is in the vicinity of Singapore.\n          </p>\n          <h1 className=\"text-xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900\">\n            Inter-monsoon (Mar - May)\n          </h1>\n          <p className=\"mb-8 leading-relaxed\">\n            This phase is characterized by light and variable winds. Daily\n            maximum temperatures which can exceed 32 °C and afternoon and late\n            night thunderstorms.\n          </p>\n          <h1 className=\"text-xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900\">\n            Southwest Monsoon (Jun - Sep)\n          </h1>\n          <p className=\"mb-8 leading-relaxed\">\n            During this monsoon season Sumatra Squalls occasionally occurs\n            between dawn and noon. With wnd gusts that can reach up to 40-80\n            km/h. Afternoon showers are also common. Southeasterly to southerly\n            winds are frequent in this period.\n          </p>\n          <h1 className=\"text-xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900\">\n            Inter-monsoon (Oct - Nov)\n          </h1>\n          <p className=\"mb-8 leading-relaxed\">\n            This phase is characterized by light and variable winds.
