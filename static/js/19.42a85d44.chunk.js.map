The National Environment Agency in\n            Singapore reports PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations for five locations\n            across the country. During the haze episodes, the NEA recommends to\n            refer to 1-hour PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration readings which are a\n            better indicator of the current outdoor air pollution for immediate\n            activities. For example going out for a run or a walk. On the other\n            hand, the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) values are based on the\n            last 24-h data consequently PSI readings are more useful when\n            planning for activities in the coming days or events during which\n            participants will be outdoors for an extended period of time.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"mb-8 leading-relaxed\">\n            The NEA calculates classifies the concentrations of 1-hr PM\n            <sub>2.5</sub> in four categories as follows: \"normal\", \"elevated\",\n            \"high\" and \"very high\" and for each category provides health\n            recommendations.\n          </p>\n          {/* todo add table for PM2.5 https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/news/index/new-personal-guide-based-on-1-hr-pm2.5-concentration-readings-to-guide-the-public-during-haze-season*/}\n          {/*  todo add link to NEA website */}\n          {/*  todo write about activities */}\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default WikiPM25;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
