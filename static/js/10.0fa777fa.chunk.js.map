The highest\n            temperature excursions are observed intra-day, where the\n            temperatures at night are significantly lower than during the day.\n            These fluctuations are mainly influenced by the solar heating.\n          </p>\n          <h1 className=\"text-2xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900\">Seasons</h1>\n          <p className=\"mb-8 leading-relaxed\">\n            Singapore climate is characterized by two distinct monsoon seasons\n            separated by two inter-monsoonal periods. One monsoon season\n            (Northeast Monsoon) periodically occurs between December and early\n            March, while the second monsoon season is from June to September\n            (Southwest Monsoon).\n          </p>\n          <h1 className=\"text-xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900\">\n            Northeast Monsoon (Dec - Mar)\n          </h1>\n          <p className=\"mb-8 leading-relaxed\">\n            Is generally characterized by northerly to northeasterly winds and\n            it has two distinct phases. The wet phase (December to early\n            January) features moderate to heavy rains with wind gusts that can\n            reach up to 25-35 km/h, and rapid development of afternoon showers.\n            Which are caused the sun radiation heating up the ground which in\n            turns heats up the air. Hot air rises to produce convective clouds\n            which can turn into intense thunderstorms if the monsoon-rain belt\n            is in the vicinity of Singapore.\n          </p>\n          <h1 className=\"text-xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900\">\n            Inter-monsoon (Mar - May)\n          </h1>\n          <p className=\"mb-8 leading-relaxed\">\n            This phase is characterized by light and variable winds.
